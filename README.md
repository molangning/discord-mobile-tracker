# discord-mobile-tracker
Tracks updated files and decompiles them.

Part of my efforts to data mine discord's app and to discover zero days in the app.

Repository is automatically updated every 8 hours.

For decompiling index.android.bundle and files, use [P1sec/hermes-dec](https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec)

## TODO
- [ ] Automatic decompiliation
- [ ] Historic releases
